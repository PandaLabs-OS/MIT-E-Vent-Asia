# MIT-E-Vent-PandaLabs
Based on the MIT Emergency Ventilator project adapted to production and parts that are readily available.

The original ventilator design toolbox can be found at the following link:
https://e-vent.mit.edu

BOM is created using OPENBOM and is available at the following link:

We made several slight changes to the original design. A complete change log will be posted and kept updated with all future changes.

We used the 3D files from the original design and converted them for use with Autodesk Fusion 360. We will post our 3D files in .stp and native .f3z formats.
